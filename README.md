# What is CodeIgniter

**CodeIgniter** is an Application Development **MVC** Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

# What is API 

API is the acronym for **Application Programming Interface**, which is a software intermediary that **allows two applications to talk to each other.** Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.

# Server Requirements

**PHP version 5.6 +** recommended.

It should work on 5.6 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
